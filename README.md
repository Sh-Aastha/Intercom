## HOW TO RUN THE CODE
>
* You'll find a jar named **Intercom-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar** which as the name suggests has the dependencies bundled with the code.
* To run it you'll just need to copy it to any folder, *cd 'to/that/folder'*, also copy the customers.txt in the same folder and run `java -jar Intercom-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar`
* If you don't have java setup in your system you can do so by following the steps mentioned [here] (https://java.com/en/download/help/download_options.xml)
* Also including the code for your reference, the jar was build using the *mvn clean install* command.
